- Device & Usage Data: device type, OS version, app version, crash logs, analytics events, timestamps, IP addresses, and performance metrics.
- Media Files: images and other media you upload; stored in our object storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2 or similar).
- Optional Data: contact list or social connections only if you explicitly import them.

### Legal Basis (where applicable)

### Data Sharing & Third Parties

- Service Providers: we may share data with hosting, analytics, crash-reporting, email, and storage providers (e.g., cloud hosting, push notification services, object storage providers). These providers process data only to support our service.
- Legal Requirements: we may disclose information to comply with legal obligations or to protect rights, safety, or property.
- No Sale: we do not sell personal information for money. We will not share your data for targeted advertising without clear consent.

### Storage & Retention

- Storage Location: user content and backups are stored on our servers and third‑party providers. Data transfer may occur across borders; we protect data with standard security measures.
- Retention Period: we retain account information while the account is active and for a limited time after account deletion as needed for backups, legal obligations, and fraud prevention. You can request deletion (see Rights below).

### Your Rights

- Access & Portability: request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- Correction & Deletion: request correction or deletion of inaccurate or unnecessary data.
- Restrict Processing / Object: where applicable, request restriction or object to certain processing.

### Security

- We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data (encryption in transit, access controls). However, no system is perfectly secure; notify us promptly if you suspect a breach.

### Third-Party Links & Integrations

- The app may include links or integrations with third-party services (e.g., social logins, analytics). These services have their own privacy policies; please review them.

### Analytics & Crash Reporting

- We use analytics and crash-reporting tools to improve Feedverse. These tools may collect device identifiers, usage events, and crash traces. Where symbols or mapping files are needed for crash analysis, we use them solely for debugging.

### Push Notifications & Emails

- You may receive push notifications or emails related to your account, activity, or important announcements. You can opt out of non-essential notifications in app settings.

### How to Delete Your Account

- You can request account deletion from within the app or by contacting us. Deletion removes publicly visible content and personal data subject to backup/retention limitations. Some anonymous or aggregated data may be retained.

### International Transfers

- Data may be processed or stored outside your country. We take steps to ensure an adequate level of protection (contracts, standard contractual clauses where required).

### Changes to This Policy

- We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the updated policy and the “Last updated” date. Significant changes will be communicated via the app or email.

   - The email address associated with your Feedverse account
   - Your username (if applicable)

### What will be deleted

When your account is deleted we will remove, unless otherwise stated below:

- Account profile (username, display name, profile image)
- Personal account settings
- Private messages you have sent and received (subject to recipient retention where necessary)
- Posts, character profiles, scenario content and other user-generated content that you created (we will remove or anonymize as explained below)
- Uploaded media files (images, attachments) stored by Feedverse
- Authentication credentials and tokens

Note: If your content is part of a collaborative scenario or quoted in other users’ content, some items may be retained in anonymized form to preserve continuity. Public references may be replaced with a placeholder (e.g., “Deleted user”) where removing the content would break other users’ threads.

—

### What may be kept and retention periods

- **Backups and logs:** We may retain backups and server logs for up to 90 days for disaster recovery, fraud detection, and legal compliance. Backups are deleted according to our retention schedule.
- **Legal / compliance records:** Data required to comply with laws (tax, fraud investigations, court orders) may be retained for up to 1 year or longer if required by law.
- **Aggregated / anonymized data:** Non-identifying analytics and aggregated usage data may be retained indefinitely for product improvement.

If you require stricter deletion for any retained items for legal reasons, contact us at `support@feedverse.app` and we will review each request.

—

### Effect on other users and public content

- Content you posted publicly may have already been copied or cached by other users; we cannot guarantee deletion from other users’ devices or external systems.
- Collaborative content where multiple authors contributed may remain, but we will remove or anonymize your personal data where feasible.

—

### Timeframe & confirmation

- After verification, we will begin deletion within 7 business days.
- Most user-visible data removal will be completed within 7–30 days.
- Complete removal from backups and logs may take up to 90 days depending on retention and backup cycles.
- We will send an email confirmation when the deletion is complete.

—

### Reversing deletion

- If you change your mind within 7 days of confirming deletion, contact `privacy@feedverse.example` immediately. After 7 days, deletion is final and recovery may not be possible.

### Dispute or additional help

If you believe we have not complied with your deletion request or you have other privacy concerns, contact us at `support@feedverse.app`. You may also contact your local data protection authority for complaints in your jurisdiction.
